                AST1000F (56%)<br>
                The course introduces students to the subject of Astronomy and our place in the universe from the small scales of the Earth-Sun-Moon system to the large scales of distant galaxies. It aims to provide insight into how we study astrophysical objects via EM radiation and telescopes (theory) as well as providing a high-level overview of objects in the universe, moving outwards from our solar system to stars and stellar remnants, our galaxy and others, dark matter and cosmology, and the study of the universe at the largest scales. The course is open to all interested students as well as providing a solid introduction to those wishing to continue in astrophysics.<br>

                <br>PHI1024F (PA)<br>
                Why do we value our beliefs? We value them because we take them to be true and, as true, they are good guides. But how can we tell when a belief is true? Our only handle here is whether or not the belief is justified. So, we aim to have beliefs that are justified. The course concentrates on the practical business of appraising justifications. Of course, we all routinely attempt to justify our beliefs and arrive at new beliefs on the basis of supposed justifications. But almost as routinely we are hoodwinked. The course aims to make students better believers by making them more aware of the nature of justification, of the different sorts of justification and the pitfalls of each. At the end of it they will be less gullible and more able to explain just why a particular argument does or doesn't convince them.<br>
                <br>PHY1004W (PA)<br>
                PHY1004W is an advanced calculus-based introductory course for Science students intending to continue with second-year Physics.
