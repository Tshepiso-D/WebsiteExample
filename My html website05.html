                My Academic career<br>
                Passed Courses:<br><br>
                AST1000F (56%)<br>
                The course introduces students to the subject of Astronomy and our place in the universe from the small scales of the Earth-Sun-Moon system to the large scales of distant galaxies. It aims to provide insight into how we study astrophysical objects via EM radiation and telescopes (theory) as well as providing a high-level overview of objects in the universe, moving outwards from our solar system to stars and stellar remnants, our galaxy and others, dark matter and cosmology, and the study of the universe at the largest scales. The course is open to all interested students as well as providing a solid introduction to those wishing to continue in astrophysics.<br>
                <br>MAM1000W (50%)<br>
                The aim of this course is to introduce students to the fundamental ideas in calculus, linear algebra, and related topics. It includes differential and integral calculus of functions of one variable, differential equations, partial derivatives, vector geometry, matrix algebra, complex numbers, Taylor polynomials. This course is necessary for entry into second year mathematics.<br>
                <br>MAM1043H (UP)<br>
                The aim of this course is to introduce Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Modelling including approximations and estimation theory, numerical methods, dynamical systems and modelling and simulation of discrete and continuous processes with MATLAB and/or Julia. Exposure to research methodology and mathematical communication is provided.<br>
                <br>PHY1023H (72%)<br>
                PHY1023H is an algebra-based introductory course for Science students. Some calculus may be used. The course includes the following topics: Tools and skills: Essential mathematical, diagrammatic, and conceptual tools and skills for Physics, co-ordinate systems, vectors, rates of change, the fundamental forces, mathematical techniques and their relationship with physical phenomena. Mechanics: kinematics, forces, dynamics, momentum, impulse, work, energy, power, collisions, rotation, rotational dynamics, torque, angular momentum, static equilibrium, gravitation. Properties of matter: elasticity, hydrostatics, hydrodynamics. Vibrations and waves: simple harmonic motion, damped oscillations, forced oscillations, resonance, travelling waves, superposition, standing waves, sound waves, sound intensity and Doppler Effect.<br>
                <br>AST2003H (PA)<br>
                This course combines a large practical component (radio and optical astronomy practicals) with theoretical background in astronomical techniques, instrumentation, and data analysis. The techniques, instrumentation and data analysis section includes: Positional astronomy:<br>
                time systems, spherical astronomy, co-ordinate systems and conversions, astrometry; Detection systems: interaction of radiation and matter, ultraviolet and optical detectors; Optics and telescope design; Multi-wavelength astronomy: infrared, ultraviolet, x-ray and gammaâ€“ray astronomy, fundamentals of radio astronomy; Observational techniques: photometry and spectroscopy; Orthodox statistics: probability distributions, Chi-squared distribution, propagation of errors; Stochastic processes and noise: photon noise.<br>
                <br>PHI1024F (PA)<br>
                Why do we value our beliefs? We value them because we take them to be true and, as true, they are good guides. But how can we tell when a belief is true? Our only handle here is whether or not the belief is justified. So, we aim to have beliefs that are justified. The course concentrates on the practical business of appraising justifications. Of course, we all routinely attempt to justify our beliefs and arrive at new beliefs on the basis of supposed justifications. But almost as routinely we are hoodwinked. The course aims to make students better believers by making them more aware of the nature of justification, of the different sorts of justification and the pitfalls of each. At the end of it they will be less gullible and more able to explain just why a particular argument does or doesn't convince them.<br>
                <br>PHY1004W (PA)<br>
                PHY1004W is an advanced calculus-based introductory course for Science students intending to continue with second-year Physics. It features the modelling of physical systems from fundamental principles, and computational problem solving using VPython. The course includes the following topics: Modern mechanics: Conservation laws, the momentum principle, atomic nature of matter, conservation of energy, energy in macroscopic systems, energy quantization, multi-particle systems, exploring the nucleus, angular momentum, entropy. Electric and magnetic interactions: Electric fields, electric potential, magnetic fields, electric circuits, capacitance, resistance, magnetic force, Gauss' Law, Ampere's Law, Faraday's Law, induction, electromagnetic radiation, waves and particles.</p>
